# ResponsiveCommentBox
Creating a comment box is an essential feature on any website that allows users to provide feedback or comments.

a) Step 1 (HTML Code):

To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our comment box.

After creating the files just paste the following below codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

The code starts by defining the document type as HTML and setting the language of the page to English.

The head section of the code contains the title of the page, which is "Comment Box". 
It also includes some meta information, such as the character encoding used in the page (UTF-8) and the width of the viewport.
